Installing CROPS
----------------

.. note::

   We are working together with CCP4 to include CROPS in their software toolkit. For now, this is an independent software. 

You can install this package using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install crops

Installing dependencies
-----------------------

The only software dependency required is GEMMI. Follow `this link <https://gemmi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_ for installation instructions.

We also recommend that you download and keep updated the two databases that CROPS makes use of:

* from `SIFTS <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/sifts/quick.html>`_, the pdb_chain_uniprot.csv;
* from `UniClust <https://uniclust.mmseqs.com/>`_ the most recent realease of the Uniclust (consensus) database in *.fasta* format.
